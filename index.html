        <p>My name is Carlo Ortega. I was born in Trujillo, Peru but have been living in North Carolina for the past 19
            years. I recently graduated from Wingate University with a major in Music Performance emphasis in piano.
            Music has been my background for a majority of my life, but now I am ready to change career paths into
            coding!</p>
        <p>I enjoy the outdoors and staying active. Few of my favorite activities include rugby, disc golf, fishing,
            basketball, and football! Everything I just mentioned is for playing/watching too.</p>
