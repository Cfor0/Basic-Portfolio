            <p>My name is Carlo Ortega. I was born in Trujillo, Peru but have been living in North Carolina
                for the past 19
                years. I recently graduated from Wingate University with a major in Music Performance
                emphasis in piano.
                Music has been my background for a majority of my life, but now I am ready to change career
                paths into
                coding!</p>
            <p>I enjoy the outdoors and staying active. Few of my favorite activities include rugby, disc
                golf, fishing,
                basketball, and football! Everything I just mentioned is for playing/watching too.</p>
